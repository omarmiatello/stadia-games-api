  "description": "Elemental War 2 offers you the popular tower defense feeling combined with innovative game mechanics: as soon as you defeat an elemental - a particularly strong enemy that will demand everything from you - you\u0027ll receive its element stone, which you can use to build new defense towers. As you keep collecting elements, you\u0027ll always have new levels and tower combinations at your disposal. Only if you skillfully combine the different towers and make use of their advantages will you be able to stand up to the monster hordes. Through in-game side quests, you\u0027ll also unlock items that further enhance the abilities of your towers or decisively weaken your opponents at just the right time!",

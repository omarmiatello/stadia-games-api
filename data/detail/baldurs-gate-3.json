Learn more about early access Early Access contains Act 1 of Baldur\u0027s Gate 3, which is planned to be a 3 Act game. Act 1 contains around 25 hours of content for your first playthrough, but is designed to be played multiple times.

Please‌ ‌head‌ ‌to‌ ‌our‌ ‌official‌ ‌site‌ ‌to‌ ‌join‌ ‌the‌ ‌discussions!‌ Community Site. Gather your party, and return to the Forgotten Realms in a tale of fellowship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival, and the lure of absolute power. Mysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a Mind Flayer parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil. From the creators of Divinity: Original Sin 2 comes a next-generation RPG, set in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. Baldur\u0027s Gate 3 supports Crowd Choice, a Stadia Enhanced Feature",

  "description": "OUTRIDERS WORLDSLAYER is a brutal 1-3 player co-op looter shooter set in an original, dark sci-fi universe. The full experience of OUTRIDERS WORLDSLAYER includes the original OUTRIDERS game, with all the numerous quality of life improvements and Expedition content added since launch. You’ll create your own Outrider from one of 4 powerful classes and journey across the diverse and deadly planet Enoch. Begin with the original OUTRIDERS campaign or use the boost to jump straight into the Worldslayer campaign with a fully geared up level 30 Outrider. Here you will face off against the most deadly Altered ever encountered - Ereshkigal, in humanity’s last fight for survival. Beyond her even greater horrors exist in the ultimate endgame experience taking place in the ancient ruins of Tarya Gratar.",

  "description": "Ryan’s friends have been kidnapped by evil the Dark Titan, Robo Combo, and Packrat – and only you can rescue them! Set out on a quest across four exciting worlds packed with slime, spaceship-flying bosses, and Ryan’s Surprise Eggs. Launch yourself in Gill’s barrels, eat Moe’s power-up pizza, and even ride on a giant Shelldon. Give your character a unique style with costumes you can buy in the shop. And play fun minigames like Spaceship Flight and The Floor is Lava. It’s an awesome adventure for one or two players. Can you defeat Dark Titan and his fiendish allies?",
